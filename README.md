<b>What is Save the Forest?</b>
<p><i>Save the Forest</i> is a browser based game focusing on the issue of forest fires. Players will have to keep their forest alive for as long as possible by clicking on forest fires when they appear on trees. As the game progresses facts about forest fires pop out, so not only is the game fun but it's also educational! After the game, players can learn more by visiting our Learn page which contains a plethora of facts and links related to forest fires.</p>

<b>Story behind Save the Forest</b>
<p>Forest fires are an extremely serious problem in British Columbia (BC). For the past few years BC fire seasons have been progressively getting worst and something needs to be done to stop this trend. As a team we hope that our game can educate a younger generation on the causes of forest fires and thus prevent them from occurring in the first place.</p>
