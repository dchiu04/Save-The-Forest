                                <p class="card-text">Growing up as a second generation Canadian of Asian descent, Debby is frequently asked “Where are you from?” to which she answers “Canada!”. 
                                  She hopes to one day be freed of the awkwardness of answering that question as well as correcting the spelling of her name. 
                                  She was introduced to technology early on in life as her father was an avid fan of computer games. 
                                  From there, she became interested in learning about technology and its effects on the world around us. 
                                  In her free time, she enjoys playing video games, binge watching a wide variety of shows/movies, and spending time with her loved ones. 
                                  She has worked in the front-end of Loblaws City Market, and as a server at Gyo-O Japanese restaurant. 
                                  She hopes to graduate from BCIT with a broader range of skills and lifelong friendships.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Joshua Geransky is a CST student at BCIT and has lived in British Columbia his entire life.
                                  He recently graduated from high school and hasn’t had much in the way of job experience, although he does have a somewhat successful YouTube channel by the name of ‘91Tech’ that focuses on older technology.
                                  Josh isn’t a terribly passionate person but considers himself to at least do have a decent job on most projects he works on, including this one.
                                  When he’s not using Comic Sans Josh enjoys watching Netflix until his eyes dry out or playing the odd video game- until he gets bored of that and replays Skyrim for the millionth time.
                                  He also owns a 2015 Ford Mustang that he is much too proud of.
                                  Josh aspires to be completely self-employed one day, but for now is hard at work attempting to pass his classes at BCIT.</p>

                                  Aleksandra recently worked on an Ecocity related project with a team of fellow CST students called Greenpoints that would allow users to earn points for recycling. 
                                  Currently, she is working with a team of passionate individuals to implement an educational game for children and adults to increase awareness about the dangers of the forest fires and about preventive measures that everyone has to learn. 
                                  When she is not working on the projects, she enjoys hiking at the local trails in Vancouver, reading motivational literature, and dancing at the social dancing events.
